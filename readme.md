Interview Linked List Example

Inspired by an interview live coding challenge,
this provides only sufficient to implement
a remove first occurrence method.

Note that forwards and backwards links are stored in the Node,
this enables slightly more elegant code however
it would be possible to only store forwards links if this was a concern.
